function alignedShapes = alignShapes(allShapes, scaling)
% ALIGNSHAPES uses Procrustes analysis to align a set of shapes (with or without
% scaling).
%
%	INPUT
%       allShapes: [2*n_landmarks x n_shapes], n_shapes is basically n_subjects
%           Collected from the HD scan semi-automated segmentation           
%           for each row: 20 points (40 elements): x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., x20, y20%           %
%       scaling: (bool) Do you want to scale your images or not? (default = 0)
%
%	OUTPUT
%       alignedShapes: The realigned shapes. Same shape as totalShapes
%
%   Shape analysis techniques based on this paper:
%   Cootes, T. F., Taylor, C. J., Cooper, D. H., & Graham, J. (1995).
